                                  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 First of all, I would like to thank God for bringing me into the world strong, healthy, and into a family like mine.
      To my mom for spoiling me in a good way and being my first example of a great woman and mother,
  To my father for building in me all the values that a man should have in order to survive in the modern world,
To my brother for being my other half and going through all the pain and learning together, all battles that made us
                                       strong with blood, sweat, and tears.
                    To my sister and niece for all the unconditional love that I feel in my heart,
       To Royler Gracie, my mentor, friend, older brother, sensei and everything in the martial arts world,
        To all my students that I’ve been teaching all over the world, especially the ones in Gracie Tijuca,
   To Chris Blanke and Lucas Beddow for being my American older brothers and helping me in my decisions,
                        To all of you that love the art that means the world to me: Jiu-Jitsu.
                                                                                                      —Saulo Ribeiro

  To Haley, for the hours and hours of hard work, redesigns, and brainstorming sessions to make sure this book
                                               became a reality.
To John Danaher, for being a gentleman and a scholar. Without your guidance and mentorship, this book would not
                                                 be what it is.
           To Billie Hunt, for dotting the “i”s and crossing the “t”s. Thank you so much for everything.
                           To all my friends and family, thanks for enabling my dream.
                                                                                                      —Kevin Howell
                                      Introduction to Jiu-Jitsu
    “Technical knowledge is not enough. One must transcend techniques so that the art
                becomes an artless art, growing out of the unconscious.”
                                                                                                     —Daisetsu Suzuki

                                                   LEVERAGE
      Rickson Gracie seeded and molded all my philosophy and thinking regarding jiu-jitsu. I am thankful not only
for his technique and competition strategy, but for all his knowledge. This is what I teach today. My jiu-jitsu is
based on his knowledge of leverage.
      Everybody talks about leverage, but few people use it in their jiu-jitsu. Everything I show in this book relates to
the efficiency of the lever and the fulcrum. How can I lift a man twice as heavy as myself? How can I armlock
someone who is three times as strong? The answer is always the same – leverage. Keep this in mind when grappling.
Always look for positions that multiply your perceived strength while minimizing that of your opponent. These are
the leverage points that must be sought.

                                            FEELING JIU-JITSU
      “If you think, you are late. If you are late, you use strength. If you use strength, you tire. And if you tire, you
die.”
      This is one of my favorite quotes, and it means that all jiu-jitsu must be based on how you feel your opponent.
The timing to make a decision is not based on what you think you should be doing. It is about your body recognizing
the move and automatically doing it. It’s about muscle memory. For example, when someone is passing your guard,
you feel he is passing so you cannot wait to decide what to do. There is no time for thought – only reaction.
      This is one thing I developed a long time ago from my teachers – my jiu-jitsu would be based on reaction.
When you react, you don’t give your mind the time to get filled with emotions. You are devoid of anger, fear, and
frustration; you are simply moving. If your opponent is pushing your elbow and you’re tired and almost hurt, it
doesn’t matter because you are reacting already; you haven’t given yourself time to get upset. That’s why I follow
this motto: no mind. If you do not think, you must feel your opponent and react accordingly.

                                            THE BELT SYSTEM
     The jiu-jitsu belt system serves to indicate the level of a practitioner’s experience. The belts range from the
novice levels of white and blue belt to the intermediate level of purple to the advanced levels of brown and black.
The following is an indication of what a student should look for at each level.

                                                 WHITE BELT
      I compare the white belt to the beginning of the life cycle, from birth to socialization. Just as the child must
trust his mother, the white belt must believe in the good will of his instructor. There will be time for questioning, but
for now he must focus and train. I believe white belts should be exposed to all the possible attacks, moves, and
positions that jiu-jitsu entails because I want them to become aware of how to do everything correctly to progress.
      Many think that some moves are too advanced for white belts. I disagree. I think that part of a white belt’s
foundation is to know all the aspects of jiu-jitsu. Although the white belt cannot dive into the intricacies of every
little thing but must start with proper fundamentals, knowledge of what those intricacies are is necessary for
progress to happen. If you are going to be attacked by it, you might as well know it. It’s a matter of learning
survival. White belts won’t be able to perfect any of it until they have learned to survive.
      As a journey, the duration of the white belt is between six to eighteen months, depending on the student’s
background. Because the transition from white to blue belt is the most important process that an individual must go
through in jiu-jitsu, I make sure each student is ready for his promotion.
      Some people feel that talent or athleticism should result in an instant promotion to a higher belt. You may be a
good wrestler and can beat a few guys, but what about your principles and fundamentals? I will not promote
someone because he can use strength; I must see more than that. This is why I must know all my white belts, and I
will accompany them as they grow as people and practitioners of jiu-jitsu.
                                                   BLUE BELT
      Aside from black belt, blue belt is probably the rank in which students will spend most of their time. This is
because here they start to develop their own ways of doing things after they have learned the fundamentals of jiu-
jitsu. Blue belts start to develop different games and options and they will test everything they see until they build
their own game. Therefore, the blue belt is the belt of experimentation. Students will experiment with all kinds of
guards and techniques until they see what works for them. These discoveries take considerable time, and this is why
a blue belt is often one of the longest processes in jiu-jitsu.

                                                 PURPLE BELT
      The purple belt is the level where a student starts to refine his technique while mentoring others. As he reflects
on his own journey as a blue belt, the purple belt assists lower ranking students by teaching them to avoid the pitfalls
that he experienced. In this way, purple belts need contact with blue belts.
      Meanwhile, brown belts will sharpen him, work on his speed, and push his defense. In this way, the brown belt
will push a purple belt in a way that the blue cannot. It is a back and forth learning experience.
      This is also the level where a student begins to get more access to black belts. A black belt can really challenge
the purple belt, and the purple belt reminds the black belt of his time spent in the toughest stage of learning. From
the beginning of the purple belt to the end, the student should be getting closer to the black belt level of knowledge.
This knowledge is what I look for in my higher purple belts.
      To become a brown belt, the purple belt must believe in his skill level. He doesn’t let the blue and white belts
interfere with his confidence. Also, he must be respectful of his fellow students and have the ability to connect
defense and offense. Once he has fulfilled this, he is ready for a brown belt.

                                                 BROWN BELT
     A brown belt is almost a black belt. A brown belt’s focus is on polishing the rough edges to tighten his game.
This is the belt where helpful tips take a student to the next level. These tips are the only difference between brown
and black belts. For a brown belt the important lessons sound like, “Move a little more to this side when you do
this…” These small alterations will make all the difference in becoming a black belt. This is why it is important to
have black belts around. They are veterans who have already been there and have seen everything students will see.

                                 BELIEVING IN YOUR YOUR RANK
      If you worry about the time and speed of your promotions, you lose yourself. Remember, before you are a blue,
purple, or brown belt, you want to feel like one. You must feel that your skills are there. You cannot fool yourself.
Attaining a belt is just proof that your teacher is connected with you. You will know when you deserve it. My role as
an instructor is to be there to say, “It’s time.” But you should already realize this on your own.
      Jiu-jitsu is not math, and promotion is not based on attendance or calendar dates. A regimented promotion
schedule based on dates or attendance is the worst way to gauge development. Jiu-jitsu is more complex than this.
      There is no sense in chasing a belt and getting it as fast as possible. Often, people do not see that black belt will
be their longest belt. Remember, it doesn’t matter if you get it in four years or fifteen. Either way, you will have the
rest of your life with a black belt around your waist. Building the black belt is what matters.

                         THE BELT SYSTEM AS USED IN THIS BOOK
     This book uses the belt system differently than other instructional manuals on jiu-jitsu. Although the belts
should not be used dogmatically (of course there will be opportunities for white belts to use submissions) they are a
frame of reference for the skills that you should absorb in each level of your jiu-jitsu journey. For example, the
purple belt should understand the guard before moving on to the brown belt. If the student achieves the brown belt
rank and does not know the guard, it will be much more difficult learning to pass! The purpose of this system is to
create a solid foundation for the student and to promote technical growth and confidence. Therefore, the white belt
will start in a position that he must become accustomed to – the bottom. On the other side of the scale, the black belt
will be at the top of the food chain sharpening his top game submissions, just as he would in reality.

                                  JIU-JITSU AND THE INDIVIDUAL
     Jiu-jitsu is an individual sport where you need partners in order to progress. However, comparing yourself with
your partners only hinders your experience. I’m going to treat you as an isolated individual. When I see you grapple,
I am not impressed if you win or lose. What I want to see is your use of the fundamentals of jiu-jitsu. It does not
matter how it ends. I do not care if you tap five times as long as you try to use technique.

                               REACHING A HIGH LEVEL IN JIU-JITSU
      Ego is the biggest hindrance in reaching a high level in jiu-jitsu. Often, it is difficult to compartmentalize your
ego, especially when you have to perform in front of the class. It is natural to worry about how good you look, but to
be good you cannot have that mentality. Don’t try to look good! It is not important that others are watching while
you are failing. It only matters that you try.
      Practice jiu-jitsu with a child-like mind. Have you ever considered why children have such an accelerated
learning curve? Part of the reason is that they are more concerned with enjoyment than ego. Try to envelop yourself
in a child’s naivety. Today, all the white belts will mount you. Tomorrow, everybody catches you in armbars. How
often do you see a higher-ranked student allow a lower-ranked one to catch a submission? Few people do it and this
all comes back to ego.

                                  LEARNING OUTSIDE THE ACADEMY
     Everything that is good for your body is good for the practice of jiu-jitsu. This includes surfing, hiking, a
healthy diet, and a host of other activities. Besides keeping you nimble and strong, these activities can relax your
mind and body, leaving you rejuvenated and ready for jiu-jitsu practice. You can sharpen skills with meditation,
physical conditioning, and a stretching system. Ginnastica Natural, an exercise and stretching method that
incorporates mechanics from, yoga and jiu-jitsu, is one way of doing this. Every Ginnastica Natural exercise can be
done without a partner, which is a great way to learn jiu-jitsu’s many body movements. This allows you to develop
sport specific conditioning and flexibility that go hand in hand with your technical development.
     You can also boost your learning curve if you take the time to learn from various media sources such as books
and videos. However, in the end you will have to train with a partner to commit the techniques to muscle memory.




    Kettlebells are a great complement to jiu-jitsu.

      As you train with an instructor, keep an open mind so that you are not dependant on that one instructor’s
techniques and opinions. I tell my students not to be stuck to me! If I see somebody doing something interesting, I
will introduce it to my students. Marcelo Garcia, Fernando “Terere” Augusto, Eduardo Telles, and Demian Maia all
do particular things that make me wonder, “How did he do that?” I want all my students to learn from them and
grow. It’s important to learn from more than one source because no one can have all the answers to everything. I
don’t want to limit you to the weapons I have. As an instructor, I must try to expose you to all the weapons –
everything!

                                   COMPETITION AND JIU-JITSU
      It is not necessary for every student of jiu-jitsu to enter into competitions. Some may do jiu-jitsu simply
because they enjoy gaining the knowledge. Others perhaps dislike the limelight or just don’t want to compete in this
particular sport. I love to do other sports, but I don’t have the desire to compete in those sports. Some people don’t
like to compete because they don’t know how to deal with loss. If you win, you are happy, and if you lose, your
world gets turned upside down. That is a problem. This fear of losing scares some people from competition.
      Then there are those who live and die by competition, but fail to realize it is just a game. It is a game where you
mix knowledge, strategy, timing, health, and attitude. Like any game, the best jiu-jitsu practitioner doesn’t always
win. Take the World Championship for example. Thirty guys sweat blood in their training, and there is only one
winner. What about the twenty-nine who worked so hard? Is the champion really better than all of them? It depends.
Sometimes, the person with the best technique gets eliminated in the first round.
      If you decide to compete, realize that competition is the art of dealing with pressure. Some people face pressure
early in life and others not until much later, but in every case, where there is pressure there is competition. The
student who doesn’t compete at the tournament is still competing if the pressure is there. Perhaps he even feels more
pressure than one who does go to tournaments. He fights against himself. He competes against his feelings. He
competes against his choices. This is the toughest opponent you can have – yourself. Ultimately the opponent you
will face in the ring is you, because you cannot compete successfully if you do not address internal issues that will
affect your performance. When competing, you will not even be able to think about overcoming your opponent if
you are too worried about yourself. However, if you are comfortable with your preparation, you will have the
confidence to perform. Becoming the champion is not about your opponent. It’s about you.
      Finally, if you want to learn something about someone’s jiu-jitsu, you should learn it in the academy. Many
people enter competition with hopes that it will be a fast track to getting better. However, the quality of training
partners actually has a much greater impact on skill level than competition does. Though competition can be a part
of training, it alone will not improve technique. Competition shows such a small part of any given competitor’s
knowledge that it masks what he really knows. In the academy, you can see him for who he really is. You will see
him relaxed and in the proper environment to exhibit his understanding of jiu-jitsu and educate you and others of its
benefits. This is what will keep jiu-jitsu evolving. Competition will always be a window to show the world how
professional the sport can be. But the growth of the sport over the coming generations will not be reliant on the
competitive aspect.

                                          SURVIVAL
       “A warrior is tuned to survive, and he survives in the best of all possible ways.”
                                                                                                      —Carlos Castaneda

                            1-1 WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO SURVIVE?
     Everyone has fears, and every beginning jiu-jitsu practitioner at every academy will be accompanied by those
fears when first stepping onto the mats. It may be the nightmare of claustrophobia, pain, or suffocation. In each
situation, the student defeats these fears by facing them over and over again. At any moment, the student can tap to
signal an end to the fight and start again and give it another try, over time he gradually liberates himself from the
cycle of fear. This is a natural process of mental conditioning and it is the law for every student. Through this
evolution, the grappler not only overcomes fear but also the instinctive tendencies to fight and waste energy. In
place of his fear he develops confidence, fortitude, and peace in stressful times. In other words, he liberates himself
from insecurity.
     Survival on a physical level is simply an extension of this mental conditioning. Although there are physical
techniques that I will show you how to use for survival, you must also make sure to become accustomed to the
nature of being physically attacked, and specifically to pressure and to the claustrophobic feeling of crushing weight.
In this way you will be mentally prepared to relax and let yourself go into these trying situations. Therefore, survival
will depend on the mental aspect of becoming comfortable while under duress as well as physical techniques.

            1-2 SURVIVAL AS THE FOUNDATION OF GRACIE JIU-JITSU
     It is important to realize that survival is the aspect that brings us closest to the founder of jiu-jitsu, Helio Gracie
(See Case Study 1.0). Due to his smaller stature, Helio was forced to learn how to survive against much larger and
stronger opponents. Realizing that he would not be able to out-muscle these opponents, Helio instead looked for
ways to survive. He was aware that it took much less energy to thwart his opponents’ advances than it took to
escape. His goal was simple, he may not win the fight, but he would not die. He would definitely survive.
     The result of Helio’s adaptations was astonishing; by focusing on the use of leverage as a tool for survival,
Helio Gracie evolved jiu-jitsu into an art that could benefit a smaller person in a fight against a much larger
opponent.

                                      1-3 SURVIVAL POSITIONING
      I am going to tell you something that goes against the current dogma of jiu-jitsu instruction. Survival is not
based on escaping submissions; it is about putting yourself into a position where you do not need to use muscle to
protect yourself. If it were based solely on escaping the submission, then how could we expect Helio Gracie at 130
pounds to be able to escape the tightest armlock or the deepest choke?
      Survival is about assuming a position that impedes your opponent’s offense, eliminating the chance of his
submission. It is about changing the situation to one that favors the defensive player. In doing so, you force your
opponent out of his comfort area. As a result, all of his actions become predictable because as he fights for offense
from an uncomfortable position there are only certain movements he can make.
      Survival is not about escaping, but it becomes easier to escape when you can get to a stronger defensive
position that forces your opponent into an awkward one.
      Technically speaking, you have to master every defensive aspect of a position, for example, hiding your elbows
for protection, getting to your side to create the proper angle, and, if necessary, preventing the cross face to inhibit
being controlled. You also have to be able to execute them all at once. I cannot overstate the importance of this. If
you fail to become comfortable doing all these things at once, you will be at the mercy of your opponent.
      The key to mastering all these aspects is being able to feel what it is your opponent wants. Intuition is vital to
your survival, and it will take a considerable amount of time to develop.
      To return to the question: How could Helio, or anyone for that matter, escape the deepest choke? The answer is
to first seek to avoid the position completely. Of course students need to train, learn submission defense, and get
caught several times, and this will occur naturally throughout their involvement in jiu-jitsu, but they must also
realize that the best defense is the one that avoids the danger altogether. For example, if I get stuck in a deep triangle
position, the longer I remain caught, the less likely it is that I will escape. Even with the knowledge of many triangle
escapes, I am still reacting to my opponent and this places him in control of the situation. In the end, my best
defense may be to tap. This is why all students need to know how to use positioning to avoid the submission.

                             1-4 SURVIVAL AND THE WHITE BELT
       The theme of the white belt is survival, nothing more and nothing less. After all, this is what the white belt has
to do from the first day of class. He is not going to arrive in class and beat the best. He has no one to whom he can
compare himself because he is still an empty vessel. Although one often takes up jiu-jitsu to learn submissions, the
first lesson for the beginner is survival. Before he moves on, the white belt must become a survivor.
       Beyond this, the white belt is the level where I will first test a student’s insecurity and patience. There have
been countless professionals who have walked into my academy beaming with confidence and strength, but when
they were mounted by one of my white belts, they completely panicked. Everyone has to learn patience, starting at
white belt. Eventually, by dealing with a superior power, students lose their insecurities and gains patience. This is a
benefit to survival training that will last a lifetime.
       Of course, I will give the white belt more weapons than just survival, but like the young man who goes to war,
my first goal is for him to survive and come back to his family. He doesn’t have a lot of skill yet, but if he is smart
and focuses on his defense and knowledge, he can survive.
       The white belt process teaches patience in situations of having to tap or in holding off the opponent.
Eventually, students arrive at a crossroad where I teach this key aspect: how to change the situation to prevent
having to tap out.

                                             Helpful Survival Tips
   • Always close your elbows. An open elbow is a pathway for armbars, upper body control, and poor posture.
   • Always prevent the cross-face control. If your opponent controls the direction of your head, he controls the
   direction of your entire body.
   • Never stay flat. A flat body is an immobile body.
   • Don’t push. Pushing as a defense anchors you to your opponent and immobilizes your necessary hip
   movement.
   • Use your hips and body pendulum to generate power, not your hands. Your body is a much stronger weapon
   than your arms alone.

Side Control Survival Positioning
    Needless to say, it is imperative that the white belt learns to tap, tap early, and tap often. To tap simply means,
“Okay you got me, let’s go again!” Every student should keep in mind that tapping is a positive part of the learning
process; therefore, there is no reason to try with all their might to escape in the absence of proper technique.

                              1-5 SURVIVAL AND THE UPPER BELT
      Think back to that white belt that knows some survival. The longer he lasts, the more pressure he puts on the
higher rank. This is great for the upper belt, because it forces him to move more and search for the tiniest hole in the
white belt’s defensive shell. Also, the white belt is going to test the higher rank‘s accuracy because the senior
student will often begin to rush through his movements as his foundation is disrupted by the white belt’s survival
skills. Usually, this is the point where one should transition into an escape, but the white belt is still likely to remain
in the survival position due to his inexperience and lack of transitioning skills. The upper belt will thus get to work
his skills in adaptation and transition while being challenged to find new ways to submit the white belt without force
or pure strength.
      When an upper belt visits the academy, I have a different approach to teaching survival. Schools have various
ways of receiving visitors. Sometimes, the instructor takes the biggest and best students and allows them to beat
down the visitor to prove their own worth in the academy. I do not believe this is the right approach, and it says
nothing about the students’ abilities to protect themselves.
      In my school, I use the visit of an upper belt to test my students’ abilities to survive against somebody who
doesn’t know about their survival skills. I want to see if they can make the visitor work really hard to find a hole to
attack. In addition, I want to see if our special guest has patience and whether he is going to lose his temper or get
rough with my white belts. Often enough, the visitor tries to destroy the white belt, especially when he becomes
frustrated with the white belt’s defense. In this regard, I am truly happy if my white belt can just survive in the face
of such an onslaught.
      If the visitor becomes too rough with my students, I bring him to my world and show him what it means to
survive. Now, he will have to survive against a veteran, and I will discover how his mind works when the tables are
turned. Some upper belts make excuses or fake injuries and others accept their relative lack of survival skills.
Regardless, the visiting upper belt, gives me the opportunity to watch him both when he is the hunter and the prey.
In this way I can analyze his style to see if I want to continue to welcome this guest into the academy. If he shows
kindness to the white belts, then I give him the red carpet.
      Even when upper belts visit for private lessons, I instruct them in survival. My view is that I cannot change you
or give you an entire new game in one private lesson, so I will focus on this most important area of jiu-jitsu. In all
honesty, 99 percent of the people who come in seeking these lessons do not know how to survive. If they already
understand survival, then I can go further and teach some escapes. Usually, they ask about fancy sweeps, and I tell
them that this is the last thing they need. As an instructor, I will not waste my guest’s money on these techniques
because his defense has got to be tight before he even considers fancy sweeps or the newest attacks. When these
private lessons are over the student thanks me for showing him something that he should have learned in the
beginning.

                           1-6 SURVIVAL AND THE AGING PROCESS
      For those that scoff at the idea that survival has to be the foundation of jiu-jitsu, look no further than your older
students. Gone are the days of superior athleticism and endless endurance, so the emphasis has to be on defense. In
this regard, as my students get older I don’t tell them that they will be beating younger students, but I state that
younger students only using technique are going to have an incredibly difficult time finding space to attack. This is
because I teach all my students to seal up their holes. Beating your opponent is about finding where he is exposed.
When the younger student faces one of my aging students and finds that there are no holes, he has to get rough to
open them. This is a great proof of the technique of the older student and shows why everyone should always strive
to seal off holes in their defense. If you seal off all of them, you can defend against more athletic as well as stronger
opponents, and age is no longer a determining factor.

   Case Study 1.0:
   Helio Gracie - The Ninety-Year Old Warrior
    Photo: Saulo’s Personal Archive

      The last time I trained with Helio Gracie was a truly memorable experience and is to this day the most
important class I ever had on jiu-jitsu. What struck me most was how Helio addressed me. He did not hold me in
awe for my titles or championships, and what he said more than surprised me. He said, “Son, you’re strong, you’re
tough, you’re a world champion, but I don’t think you can beat me.” At the time, I just looked at him sideways in
disbelief. After all, how could a ninety-year-old beat someone who is in his athletic prime? It was at this moment
that I realized how he deftly put all the responsibility on me to defeat him. This is the key to Helio; he never says he
will beat you, only that you will not beat him.
      This is important because he believes he will survive. His survival has nothing to do with perfect timing or
strength. Instead, it has everything to do with mastering the defensive aspects of jiu-jitsu. He didn’t say he would
escape from my position, or that he would do anything else. He said he would survive.
      The result of our training only validated that fact. Helio did survive, and I was not able to impose my game on
him. Helio proved to me the importance of survivability and the defensive nature of jiu-jitsu. Furthermore, I took
from him one of the greatest lessons ever: It is not enough to be able to defeat all of your challengers. To be able to
tell any man that he cannot defeat you is to wield true power.

                             1-7 CLOSING THOUGHTS ON SURVIVAL
     Survival is a process that will continue to develop over a lifetime in jiu-jitsu and this is why it is not only the
theme of the white belt, but also the theme of jiu-jitsu as a whole. Show me a world champion and time will show
you someone who is put here to make him survive.
